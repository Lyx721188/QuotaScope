//! Cursor's limits, read from the account with the login the editor already
//! stored on this PC.
//!
//! Cursor bills a **month** rather than a rolling window, and what the plan
//! includes is **two separate pools**, which is how the account page draws
//! it: one for Cursor's own models (Composer, Cursor Grok) and one for
//! everything else. Spending past the first eats into the second, and past
//! that into whatever extra spend the account has agreed to — so they are
//! three different limits and are reported as three windows, all resetting
//! with the billing cycle.
//!
//! The login is Cursor's own OAuth token, sitting in the SQLite database VS
//! Code keeps global state in — see `cursor_app_login` below. The website,
//! though, authenticates with a **cookie** rather than a bearer header, and
//! that cookie is not stored anywhere to be found. It is *built*: the
//! account id is the tail of the token's own `sub` claim, and the cookie's
//! value is that id and the token joined by `::`. Which is the whole reason
//! this provider needs nothing from the user.
//!
//! `GET cursor.com/api/usage-summary` is not public API, exactly like the
//! CLI routes, and can change without notice.
