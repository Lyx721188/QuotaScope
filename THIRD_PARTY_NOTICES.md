The Windows app ships copies of the Lobe-derived provider marks, rasterised for its own renderer
(`windows/quotascope-win/assets/icons`). It is written in Rust against the
Microsoft Windows SDK via the [`windows`](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs)
crate, and links against further crates from crates.io — overwhelmingly
dual-licensed MIT OR Apache-2.0. The pinned list with versions is
`windows/Cargo.lock`, and each crate's repository carries its licence text;
the SQLite engine compiled into `rusqlite` (the `bundled` feature) is in the
public domain.

The Claude, OpenAI, Antigravity, Cursor, OpenCode, Kimi, Ollama, Z.ai, 智谱
and 清言, MiniMax, GitHub, Grok and xAI, and Volcengine names and marks remain
the property of their respective owners. Their inclusion identifies compatible
services and does not imply endorsement.
